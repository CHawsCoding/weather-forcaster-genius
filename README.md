# WEATHER-FORCASTER-GENIUS

The goal of this project was to build an app that tells you the current weather along with a 5-day forcast for the city that the user searches. I want the current weather to display in a big card on the right hand side of the screen on the desktop site and have the 5 day forcast populate below that with each day getting it's own card. On the mobile version the current weather will populate first on its own row and then the 5 day forcast will display below in a 2-day per row format. I also want to save recently searched cities so the user can click on them to revisit the weather for that city.

## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

Just a Web browser to open the deployed github pages version of the application.

## PRODUCT ROADMAP 

I will be adding some better search functionality. For example, there's no way to be specific about the state, or country the city is in. If I search for my home city of ST George, UT the actual weather that displays is a city called St George in Australia. 

There will be major changes to the CSS Styling for the next update. There was a time cruch to get the MVP deployed and so the CSS was the most rushed aspect of the first deployed version. 

Will be adding a feature that will save the last 10 searched cities and it will persist on refresh using local storage
