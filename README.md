# weather-forcaster-genius

The goal of this project was to build an app that tells you the current weather along with a 5-day forcast for the city that the user searches. I want the current weather to display in a big card on the right hand side of the screen on the desktop site and have the 5 day forcast populate below that with each day getting it's own card. On the mobile version the current weather will populate first on its own row and then the 5 day forcast will display below in a 2-day per row format. I also want to save recently searched cities so the user can click on them to revisit the weather for that city.

## Software Needed

Just a Web browser to open the deployed github pages version of the application.
